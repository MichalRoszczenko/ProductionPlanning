# Production Planning
Welcome to the Production Planning app! 

This application is based on the foundations of my previous work and is intended for production planning in the plastics industry. 
With this app, you can easily create production plans, manage tools and machines, and track material inventories, all with a simple user interface.
All data is saved in the database.

For proper operation, I recommend running application in Visual Studio. 
Before starting, use the Package Manager Console (Visual Studio -> Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console) 
and enter the command 'update-database' to create the database on your local device.

Afterward, select 'Production.Presentation' project and run the application.
